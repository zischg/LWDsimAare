Simulation of large wood dynamics during an extreme flood in the Aare River upstream of Bern, Switzerland

This repository contains the code, the data, and the results of the simulation of woody debris transport during an extreme flood in the Aare River, Sitzerland. 
It should document the work done for the submitted paper "Modelling spatiotemporal dynamics of large wood recruitment, transport and deposition at river reach scale during extreme floods". The repository will be updated and documented after final publication.
Code developed by Niccolo Galatioto.
